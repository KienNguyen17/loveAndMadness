As a fiction writer, first and foremost, I am fascinated by forms and mediums in storytelling. In particular, I wanted to investigate forms of narrative that straddle the line between fiction and nonfiction. In one direction, we have works of fiction that attempt to present itself as reality, such as epistolary novels, found footage movies or other kinds of stories that involve a large degree of meta fiction surrounding its creation. In the other direction, we have works that are purportedly non-fiction, such as memoirs, biographies, or biopics, but carry a certain license for inaccuracies and rewriting of facts. This latter category might seem more nebulous and even contentious, as one would argue that memoirs and biographies are categorically nonfiction. However, this

To collect one’s life into a volume, even multiple volumes, seems hard to reconcile. As such, every act of omission, and by extension inclusion, is deliberate. Despite its express purpose to record the fact of one’s life, the autobiography is a curated view of one’s life, framed in the way its author wishes to perform to the public. Further than that, given the extent to which writing could surpass one’s death, the autobiography is a fossilized version of something as ephemeral and all-encompassing as one’s life. That is not to mention the treatment of the text post-mortem, through the augmentation of editors and publishers who carry concerns about publicity, printing cost or personal agenda.
